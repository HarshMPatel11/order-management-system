Project Overview:
You will build an Order Management feature for a food delivery app. The goal is to
create a simple, functional part of the app that allows users to place orders, view
the menu, and track the order status.
Feature Requirements:

Menu Display: ○ A list of food items (e.g., pizza, burgers, etc.) displayed on the UI. ○ Each item has a name, description, price, and image.
Order Placement: ○ Users can add items to their cart. ○ Users can specify the quantity of each item in the cart. ○ Users can proceed to checkout, where they enter their delivery details (name, address, phone number).
Order Status: ○ Once the order is placed, show the status (e.g., “Order Received”, “Preparing”, “Out for Delivery”). ○ Real-time updates of the status (this can be simulated in the back-end).
Back-End: ○ REST API to handle order placement, menu retrieval, and updating order status. ○ Store order details and menu items in-memory or a simple database.
Test-Driven Development (TDD): ○ Write tests for the API endpoints and key UI components. ○ Tests should cover CRUD operations for orders, input validation, and order status updates.
User Interface: ○ A simple UI that allows users to interact with the menu, add items to the cart, and place orders. ○ Use React with Vite or Next.js for the front-end.
Real-Time Updates (Optional but Encouraged): ○ Implement a way to simulate real-time updates of the order status. Deliverables:
Code Repository: ○ A public GitHub repository with the full code for the order management feature. ○ The code should be well-structured, with a focus on readability and maintainability.
Hosted Application: Host the app on a platform like Vercel or Netlify.
Loom Video: ○ A short video (12-15 minutes) explaining your process. ■ Walk through your code and explain how you structured it. ■ Discuss the architecture and design choices. ■ Explain how you used AI tools during development (e.g., for code generation, testing, etc.). ■ Mention any challenges you faced and how you solved them. Evaluation Criteria:
Problem-Solving Approach: ○ How do you break down the requirements into smaller tasks? ○ What steps did you take to ensure scalability and maintainability in the feature?
Code Quality: ○ Is your code clean and maintainable? ○ Are the tests thorough and well-written?
UI/UX: ○ Is the UI simple but functional? ○ Is the user experience intuitive and smooth?
Back-End: ○ Are your API endpoints well-structured and secure? ○ Do you handle edge cases and input validation?
Use of AI: ○ How effectively did you use AI tools in your development? Did you leverage AI for code generation, testing, debugging, etc.?can you give me the same this things ask me for this pdf give me everything
